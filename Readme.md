# World-vue (pronounced World-view)

This script provides a simple webpage that rotates through
pictures from the Planet.com gallery. It displays the Title and
Subtitle on each picture.
There is a basic opacity-transition between each picture.

Planet.com does not have CORS setup - therefore use get\_json.sh
to download the index.json that contains the Gallery data and remove
superfluous data.
